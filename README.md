# skill-sharing

This is a project from Eloquent Javascript. Essentially it is an ultra-limited MeetUp clone that allows users to post talks with relevant information, delete talks, and/or post comments. It is an exercise in building a server with a client-side interface.

To run the application:
- `npm install`
- Run `node server.js` to start the server
- Visit `localhost:8000` to see the front-end interface
